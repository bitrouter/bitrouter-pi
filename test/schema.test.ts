/**
 * The wire contract, checked against the contract BitRouter publishes.
 *
 * `test/wire.test.ts` proves the mapper reads a captured body correctly. It
 * cannot prove the capture still resembles what the server sends — a fixture
 * is a snapshot, and a snapshot goes stale in silence. That is not a
 * hypothetical failure: this package once read `context_window`, a flat
 * `cost`, and a boolean `reasoning`, none of which BitRouter has ever sent, so
 * every model sat at its default window priced at zero. No test failed.
 * Somebody had to read the code.
 *
 * BitRouter Cloud generates an OpenAPI document from the Rust types that
 * serialize the response and serves it unauthenticated, so the contract is
 * *published* — `schema/models.schema.json` is a vendored copy, refreshed by
 * `npm run schema:refresh` and by a scheduled workflow that opens a pull
 * request when it moves.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the first one. It is not "does the fixture
 * parse"; it is "has the set of fields BitRouter serves changed since somebody
 * last looked". A new field fails this suite once, and the fix is to decide —
 * in `ACKNOWLEDGED`, in one line — whether to map it or to ignore it on
 * purpose. That is the whole mechanism: drift cannot pass silently, and
 * acknowledging it is cheap.
 *
 * The local daemon has no equivalent. `GET /v1/models` in
 * `crates/bitrouter-sdk/src/server.rs` builds its body from an inline
 * `serde_json::json!` literal rather than a schema-derived type, so there is
 * nothing published to check `local-models.json` against.
