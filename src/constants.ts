 * The model id that hands model choice back to BitRouter.

 * (`RESERVED_NAMESPACE` in `crates/bitrouter-sdk/src/config/presets.rs`), and
 * `bitrouter/auto` is the public slug for policy-driven automatic routing
 * (`AUTO_SLUG`). The vendor segment names the *router being addressed*, not the
 * token destination: the request is still fulfilled by whichever upstream
 * provider the bound policy selects.
 *
 * This is the id as it travels on the wire, so it is the id this plugin
 * advertises. The gateway never lists it in `GET /v1/models` — the namespace is
 * resolved before any provider lookup, and BitRouter's registry validator
 * refuses catalog models under `bitrouter/` so it can never be shadowed — which
 * is why this plugin has to supply the entry itself.
 *
 * It resolves only where a preset named `auto` is bound to a routing policy;
 * without one the gateway answers 400 naming `bitrouter optimize setup`.
